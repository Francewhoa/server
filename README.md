Cookbook Development
--------------------

To develop these cookbooks you need:

**knife**

Install with:

    $ sudo apt-get install chef

**This Repo**

1. Cloned to ~/Repos/hubdrop/cookbooks (or your preferred folder.)
2. Symlink from /var/chef/cookbooks -> ~/Repos/hubdrop/cookbooks

**Community Cookbooks**

Whenever possible, we should use the community cookbooks.
To add other cookbooks, you can now use knife to install community cookbooks:

    $ knife cookbook site download php
    $ knife cookbook site install php
